# scumbot
A scum bot, which I am not sure works

NO LONGER MAINTAINED
Feel free to pick up where I left off. An unfinished SCUM bot which is no longer maintained and last worked in 0.7 of SCUM.  A few functions and Discord interop are ready, more of a template.  Written in Java, can compile jar to exe with something like JSmooth or JarToExe.

Sends mouse and keyboard input using Robot, will probably need to play with game window sizing and many more things to perfect it.
